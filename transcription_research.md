# Transcription Tools Research

## OpenAI Whisper + Pyannote-Audio

OpenAI's Whisper is a state-of-the-art speech recognition system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual data. It provides accurate transcription but lacks native speaker identification (diarization) capabilities.

### Key Features:
- Multilingual support
- Robust to accents and background noise
- Open-source and free to use
- Can be run locally

### Limitations:
- No built-in speaker identification
- Requires integration with other tools for diarization

### Integration with Pyannote-Audio:
Pyannote-Audio is an open-source toolkit for speaker diarization that can be combined with Whisper:
- Identifies who is speaking in a conversation
- Provides timestamps for each speaker segment
- Can be integrated with Whisper transcriptions
- Implementation example available at: https://github.com/lablab-ai/Whisper-transcription_and_diarization-speaker-identification-

### Implementation Approach:
1. Use Pyannote-Audio to identify speaker segments with timestamps
2. Use Whisper to transcribe the audio
3. Match the transcriptions with speaker segments based on timestamps

## AssemblyAI

AssemblyAI is a commercial Speech-to-Text API with built-in speaker diarization capabilities.

### Key Features:
- Free tier with $50 in credits
- Built-in speaker diarization
- Additional audio intelligence features:
  - Speech recognition
  - Speaker diarization
  - Custom spelling and vocabulary
  - Profanity filtering, auto punctuation and casing
- Compliance with EU Data Residency standards

### Pricing:
- Free tier: $50 in credits for developers
- Pay-as-you-go: Starting at $0.12/hr for Speech-to-Text

### API Integration:
- RESTful API for easy integration
- SDKs available for various programming languages

## Comparison and Recommendation

### OpenAI Whisper + Pyannote-Audio:
- Pros: Free, open-source, can run locally without API costs
- Cons: Requires more complex integration, may have higher computational requirements

### AssemblyAI:
- Pros: Built-in speaker diarization, simple API, free credits to start
- Cons: Usage beyond free tier requires payment, relies on external service

### Recommendation:
For a free and open-source solution, the combination of Whisper and Pyannote-Audio is recommended. This approach allows for local processing without ongoing API costs, though it requires more complex integration.

For ease of implementation and if the $50 free credit is sufficient for the expected usage, AssemblyAI provides a more streamlined solution with built-in speaker diarization.

## Next Steps:
- Explore implementation details for both options
- Evaluate computational requirements for local processing
- Test accuracy of speaker identification with sample recordings
